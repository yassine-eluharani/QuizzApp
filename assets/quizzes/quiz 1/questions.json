You can use placement groups to influence the placement of a group of interdependent instances to meet the needs of your workload. Depending on the type of workload, you can create a placement group using one of the following placement strategies:Cluster placement groupPartition placement groupSpread placement group.A Spread placement group is a group of instances that are each placed on distinct racks, with each rack having its own network and power source.Spread placement groups are recommended for applications that have a small number of critical instances that should be kept separate from each other. Launching instances in a spread placement group reduces the risk of simultaneous failures that might occur when instances share the same racks.A spread placement group can span multiple Availability Zones in the same Region. You can have a maximum of seven running instances per Availability Zone per group.

An Aurora cluster volume is a virtual database storage volume that spans multiple Availability Zones, with each Availability Zone having a copy of the DB cluster data. Two types of DB instances make up an Aurora DB cluster:Primary DB instance – Supports read and write operations, and performs all of the data modifications to the cluster volume. Each Aurora DB cluster has one primary DB instance.Aurora Replica – Connects to the same storage volume as the primary DB instance and supports only read operations. Each Aurora DB cluster can have up to 15 Aurora Replicas in addition to the primary DB instance. Aurora automatically fails over to an Aurora Replica in case the primary DB instance becomes unavailable. You can specify the failover priority for Aurora Replicas. Aurora Replicas can also offload read workloads from the primary DB instance.{IMG_4} via - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Aurora.Overview.htmlAurora Replicas have two main purposes. You can issue queries to them to scale the read operations for your application. You typically do so by connecting to the reader endpoint of the cluster. That way, Aurora can spread the load for read-only connections across as many Aurora Replicas as you have in the cluster. Aurora Replicas also help to increase availability. If the writer instance in a cluster becomes unavailable, Aurora automatically promotes one of the reader instances to take its place as the new writer.While setting up a Multi-AZ deployment for Aurora, you create an Aurora replica or reader node in a different AZ.Multi-AZ for Aurora: {IMG_5}You use the reader endpoint for read-only connections for your Aurora cluster.

A good idea is to deploy a CloudWatch Alarm that notifies your team when function metrics such as ConcurrentExecutions or Invocations exceeds your threshold. You should create an AWS Budget so you can monitor costs on a daily basis.If you intend to reuse code in more than one Lambda function, you should consider creating a Lambda Layer for the reusable code - You can configure your Lambda function to pull in additional code and content in the form of layers. A layer is a ZIP archive that contains libraries, a custom runtime, or other dependencies. With layers, you can use libraries in your function without needing to include them in your deployment package. Layers let you keep your deployment package small, which makes development easier. A function can use up to 5 layers at a time.You can create layers, or use layers published by AWS and other AWS customers. Layers support resource-based policies for granting layer usage permissions to specific AWS accounts, AWS Organizations, or all accounts. The total unzipped size of the function and all layers can't exceed the unzipped deployment package size limit of 250 MB.Incorrect options:Lambda allocates compute power in proportion to the memory you allocate to your function.

Transitive Peering does not work for VPC peering connections. So, if you have a VPC peering connection between VPC A and VPC B (pcx-aaaabbbb), and between VPC A and VPC C (pcx-aaaacccc). Then, there is no VPC peering connection between VPC B and VPC C. Instead of using VPC peering, you can use an AWS Transit Gateway that acts as a network transit hub, to interconnect your VPCs or connect your VPCs with on-premises networks. Therefore this is the correct option.VPC Peering Connections Overview: {IMG_11} via - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/peering/vpc-peering-basics.htmlIncorrect options:Use an internet gateway to interconnect the VPCs - An internet gateway is a horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC component that allows communication between instances in your VPC and the internet. It, therefore, imposes no availability risks or bandwidth constraints on your network traffic. You cannot use an internet gateway to interconnect your VPCs and on-premises networks, hence this option is incorrect.Use a VPC endpoint to interconnect the VPCs - A VPC endpoint enables you to privately connect your VPC to supported AWS services and VPC endpoint services powered by AWS PrivateLink without requiring an internet gateway, NAT device, VPN connection, or AWS Direct Connect connection. You cannot use a VPC endpoint to interconnect your VPCs and on-premises networks, hence this option is incorrect.Establish VPC peering connections between all VPCs - Establishing VPC peering between all VPCs is an inelegant and clumsy way to establish connectivity between all VPCs.

SSL/TLS certificates are used to secure network communications and establish the identity of websites over the Internet as well as resources on private networks.AWS Config provides a detailed view of the configuration of AWS resources in your AWS account. This includes how the resources are related to one another and how they were configured in the past so that you can see how the configurations and relationships change over time.{IMG_20} via - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/how-does-config-work.htmlAWS Config provides AWS-managed rules, which are predefined, customizable rules that AWS Config uses to evaluate whether your AWS resources comply with common best practices. You can leverage an AWS Config managed rule to check if any ACM certificates in your account are marked for expiration within the specified number of days. Certificates provided by ACM are automatically renewed. ACM does not automatically renew the certificates that you import. The rule is NON_COMPLIANT if your certificates are about to expire.{IMG_21} via - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/how-does-config-work.htmlYou can configure AWS Config to stream configuration changes and notifications to an Amazon SNS topic. For example, when a resource is updated, you can get a notification sent to your email, so that you can view the changes. You can also be notified when AWS Config evaluates your custom or managed rules against your resources.Incorrect options:Monitor the days to expiry CloudWatch metric for certificates imported into ACM. Create a CloudWatch alarm to monitor such certificates based on the days to expiry metric and then trigger a custom action of notifying the security team - AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) does not attempt to renew third-party certificates that are imported. Also, an administrator needs to reconfigure missing DNS records for certificates that use DNS validation if the record was removed for any reason after the certificate was issued. Metrics and events provide you visibility into such certificates that require intervention to continue the renewal process. Amazon CloudWatch metrics and Amazon EventBridge events are enabled for all certificates that are managed by ACM. Users can monitor days to expiry as a metric for ACM certificates through Amazon CloudWatch. An Amazon EventBridge expiry event is published for any certificate that is at least 45 days away from expiry by default. Users can build alarms to monitor certificates based on days to expiry and also trigger custom actions such as calling a Lambda function or paging an administrator.It is certainly possible to use the days to expiry CloudWatch metric to build a CloudWatch alarm to monitor the imported ACM certificates. The alarm will, in turn, trigger a notification to the security team. But this option needs more configuration effort than directly using the AWS Config managed rule that is available off-the-shelf.Leverage AWS Config managed rule to check if any SSL/TLS certificates created via ACM are marked for expiration within 30 days.

Because DAX is API-compatible with DynamoDB, you don't have to make any functional application code changes. DAX is used to natively cache DynamoDB reads.CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) service that delivers static and dynamic web content, video streams, and APIs around the world, securely and at scale. By design, delivering data out of CloudFront can be more cost-effective than delivering it from S3 directly to your users.When a user requests content that you serve with CloudFront, their request is routed to a nearby Edge Location. If CloudFront has a cached copy of the requested file, CloudFront delivers it to the user, providing a fast (low-latency) response. If the file they’ve requested isn’t yet cached, CloudFront retrieves it from your origin – for example, the S3 bucket where you’ve stored your content.So, you can use CloudFront to improve application performance to serve static content from S3.Incorrect options:Enable ElastiCache Redis for DynamoDB and CloudFront for S3Amazon ElastiCache for Redis is a blazing fast in-memory data store that provides sub-millisecond latency to power internet-scale real-time applications.

        ],
        "correct_answer": "Use CloudTrail to analyze API calls",
        "explanation": "Correct option:Use CloudTrail to analyze API calls - AWS CloudTrail is a service that enables governance, compliance, operational auditing, and risk auditing of your AWS account. With CloudTrail, you can log, continuously monitor, and retain account activity related to actions across your AWS infrastructure. CloudTrail provides event history of your AWS account activity, including actions taken through the AWS Management Console, AWS SDKs, command-line tools, and other AWS services.In general, to analyze any API calls made within an AWS account, CloudTrail is used. You can record the actions that are taken by users, roles, or AWS services on Amazon S3 resources and maintain log records for auditing and compliance purposes. To do this, you can use server access logging, AWS CloudTrail logging, or a combination of both. AWS recommends that you use AWS CloudTrail for logging bucket and object-level actions for your Amazon S3 resources.Incorrect options:Implement an IAM policy to forbid users to change S3 bucket settings - You manage access in AWS by creating policies and attaching them to IAM identities (users, groups of users, or roles) or AWS resources. A policy is an object in AWS that, when associated with an identity or resource, defines their permissions. AWS evaluates these policies when an IAM principal (user or role) makes a request. Permissions in the policies determine whether the request is allowed or denied. Most policies are stored in AWS as JSON documents. AWS supports six types of policies: identity-based policies, resource-based policies, permissions boundaries, AWS Organizations SCPs, ACLs, and session policies.Implementing an IAM policy to forbid users would be disruptive and wouldn't go unnoticed.Use S3 access logs to analyze user access using Athena - Amazon S3 server access logging provides detailed records for the requests that are made to a bucket. Server access logs are useful for many applications. For example, access log information can be useful in security and access audits. It can also help you learn about your customer base and understand your Amazon S3 bill. AWS recommends that you use AWS CloudTrail for logging bucket and object-level actions for your Amazon S3 resources, as it provides more options to store, analyze and act on the log information.Implement a bucket policy requiring MFA for all operations - Amazon S3 supports MFA-protected API access, a feature that can enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for access to your Amazon S3 resources. Multi-factor authentication provides an extra level of security that you can apply to your AWS environment. It is a security feature that requires users to prove the physical possession of an MFA device by providing a valid MFA code. Changing the bucket policy to require MFA would not go unnoticed.References:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/logging-with-S3.htmlhttps://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.htmlhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ServerLogs.htmlhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/example-bucket-policies.html#example-bucket-policies-use-case-7"

Amazon S3 always returns the latest version of the objectAmazon S3 delivers strong read-after-write consistency automatically, without changes to performance or availability, without sacrificing regional isolation for applications, and at no additional cost.After a successful write of a new object or an overwrite of an existing object, any subsequent read request immediately receives the latest version of the object. S3 also provides strong consistency for list operations, so after a write, you can immediately perform a listing of the objects in a bucket with any changes reflected.Strong read-after-write consistency helps when you need to immediately read an object after a write. For example, strong read-after-write consistency when you often read and list immediately after writing objects.To summarize, all S3 GET, PUT, and LIST operations, as well as operations that change object tags, ACLs, or metadata, are strongly consistent.

You can use versioning to preserve, retrieve, and restore every version of every object stored in your Amazon S3 bucket. Versioning-enabled buckets enable you to recover objects from accidental deletion or overwrite.For example:If you overwrite an object, it results in a new object version in the bucket. You can always restore the previous version. If you delete an object, instead of removing it permanently, Amazon S3 inserts a delete marker, which becomes the current object version. You can always restore the previous version.

Dedicated Hosts give you additional visibility and control over how instances are placed on a physical server, and you can reliably use the same physical server over time. As a result, Dedicated Hosts enable you to use your existing server-bound software licenses like Windows Server and address corporate compliance and regulatory requirements.Incorrect options:Use EC2 dedicated instances - Dedicated instances are Amazon EC2 instances that run in a VPC on hardware that's dedicated to a single customer.

        "correct_answer": "Use multipart uploads for faster file uploads into the destination S3 bucket",
        "explanation": "Correct options:Use Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration to enable faster file uploads into the destination S3 bucket - Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration enables fast, easy, and secure transfers of files over long distances between your client and an S3 bucket. Transfer Acceleration takes advantage of Amazon CloudFront’s globally distributed edge locations. As the data arrives at an edge location, data is routed to Amazon S3 over an optimized network path.Use multipart uploads for faster file uploads into the destination S3 bucket - Multipart upload allows you to upload a single object as a set of parts. Each part is a contiguous portion of the object's data. You can upload these object parts independently and in any order. If transmission of any part fails, you can retransmit that part without affecting other parts. After all parts of your object are uploaded, Amazon S3 assembles these parts and creates the object. In general, when your object size reaches 100 MB, you should consider using multipart uploads instead of uploading the object in a single operation. Multipart upload provides improved throughput, therefore it facilitates faster file uploads.Incorrect options:Create multiple AWS direct connect connections between the AWS Cloud and branch offices in Europe and Asia. Use the direct connect connections for faster file uploads into S3 - AWS Direct Connect is a cloud service solution that makes it easy to establish a dedicated network connection from your premises to AWS. AWS Direct Connect lets you establish a dedicated network connection between your network and one of the AWS Direct Connect locations. Direct connect takes significant time (several months) to be provisioned and is an overkill for the given use-case.Create multiple site-to-site VPN connections between the AWS Cloud and branch offices in Europe and Asia. Use these VPN connections for faster file uploads into S3 - AWS Site-to-Site VPN enables you to securely connect your on-premises network or branch office site to your Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC). You can securely extend your data center or branch office network to the cloud with an AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection. A VPC VPN Connection utilizes IPSec to establish encrypted network connectivity between your intranet and Amazon VPC over the Internet. VPN Connections are a good solution if you have low to modest bandwidth requirements and can tolerate the inherent variability in Internet-based connectivity. Site-to-site VPN will not help in accelerating the file transfer speeds into S3 for the given use-case.Use AWS Global Accelerator for faster file uploads into the destination S3 bucket - AWS Global Accelerator is a service that improves the availability and performance of your applications with local or global users. It provides static IP addresses that act as a fixed entry point to your application endpoints in a single or multiple AWS Regions, such as your Application Load Balancers, Network Load Balancers or Amazon EC2 instances.

We recommend this configuration if you need to run a single-tier, public-facing web application, such as a blog or a simple website.{IMG_24} via - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Scenario1.htmlVPC with public and private subnets (NAT) - The configuration for this scenario includes a virtual private cloud (VPC) with a public subnet and a private subnet. We recommend this scenario if you want to run a public-facing web application while maintaining back-end servers that aren't publicly accessible. A common example is a multi-tier website, with the web servers in a public subnet and the database servers in a private subnet.

This strategy is typically used by large distributed and replicated workloads, such as Hadoop, Cassandra, and Kafka.Spread – strictly places a small group of instances across distinct underlying hardware to reduce correlated failures.There is no charge for creating a placement group.Use a Cluster placement group - A cluster placement group is a logical grouping of instances within a single Availability Zone. A cluster placement group can span peered VPCs in the same Region. Instances in the same cluster placement group enjoy a higher per-flow throughput limit of up to 10 Gbps for TCP/IP traffic and are placed in the same high-bisection bandwidth segment of the network.Cluster placement groups are recommended for applications that benefit from low network latency, high network throughput, or both. They are also recommended when the majority of the network traffic is between the instances in the group. To provide the lowest latency and the highest packet-per-second network performance for your placement group, choose an instance type that supports enhanced networking.Image of Cluster placement group: {IMG_30} via - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/placement-groups.htmlImage of Partition placement group: {IMG_31} via - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/placement-groups.htmlImage of Spread placement group: {IMG_32} via - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/placement-groups.htmlIncorrect options:Use Spot Instances - A Spot Instance is an unused EC2 instance that is available for less than the On-Demand price. Because Spot Instances enable you to request unused EC2 instances at steep discounts, you can lower your Amazon EC2 costs significantly. Spot Instances are a cost-effective choice if you can be flexible about when your applications run and if your applications can be interrupted. Since performance is the key criteria, this is not the right choice.Optimize the EC2 kernel using EC2 User Data - Optimizing the EC2 kernel won't help with network performance as it's bounded by the EC2 instance type mainly. Therefore, this option is incorrect.Use a Spread placement group - A spread placement group is a group of instances that are each placed on distinct racks, with each rack having its own network and power source. The instances are placed across distinct underlying hardware to reduce correlated failures. A spread placement group can span multiple Availability Zones in the same Region. You can have a maximum of seven running instances per Availability Zone per group.Reference:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/placement-groups.html"

With bucket policies, you can grant users within your AWS Account or other AWS Accounts access to your Amazon S3 resources.You can further restrict access to specific resources based on certain conditions. For example, you can restrict access based on request time (Date Condition), whether the request was sent using SSL (Boolean Conditions), a requester’s IP address (IP Address Condition), or based on the requester's client application (String Conditions). To identify these conditions, you use policy keys.Types of access control in S3: {IMG_33} via - https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/aws-security-whitepaper.pdfIncorrect options:Use Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies - AWS IAM enables organizations with many employees to create and manage multiple users under a single AWS account.

        "explanation": "Correct option:Use VPC endpoint to access Amazon SQSAWS customers can access Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) from their Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) using VPC endpoints, without using public IPs, and without needing to traverse the public internet. VPC endpoints for Amazon SQS are powered by AWS PrivateLink, a highly available, scalable technology that enables you to privately connect your VPC to supported AWS services.Amazon VPC endpoints are easy to configure. They also provide reliable connectivity to Amazon SQS without requiring an internet gateway, Network Address Translation (NAT) instance, VPN connection, or AWS Direct Connect connection. With VPC endpoints, the data between your Amazon VPC and Amazon SQS queue is transferred within the Amazon network, helping protect your instances from internet traffic.AWS PrivateLink simplifies the security of data shared with cloud-based applications by eliminating the exposure of data to the public Internet. AWS PrivateLink provides private connectivity between VPCs, AWS services, and on-premises applications, securely on the Amazon network. AWS PrivateLink makes it easy to connect services across different accounts and VPCs to significantly simplify the network architecture.Incorrect options:Use Internet Gateway to access Amazon SQS - An internet gateway is a horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC component that allows communication between instances in your VPC and the internet. It, therefore, imposes no availability risks or bandwidth constraints on your network traffic. This option is ruled out as the team does not want to use the public internet to access Amazon SQS.Use VPN connection to access Amazon SQS - AWS Site-to-Site VPN (aka VPN Connection) enables you to securely connect your on-premises network or branch office site to your Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC). You can securely extend your data center or branch office network to the cloud with an AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection. A VPC VPN Connection utilizes IPSec to establish encrypted network connectivity between your intranet and Amazon VPC over the Internet. VPN Connections can be configured in minutes and are a good solution if you have an immediate need, have low to modest bandwidth requirements, and can tolerate the inherent variability in Internet-based connectivity. As the existing infrastructure is within AWS Cloud, therefore a VPN connection is not required.Use Network Address Translation (NAT) instance to access Amazon SQS - You can use a network address translation (NAT) instance in a public subnet in your VPC to enable instances in the private subnet to initiate outbound IPv4 traffic to the Internet or other AWS services, but prevent the instances from receiving inbound traffic initiated by someone on the Internet. Amazon provides Amazon Linux AMIs that are configured to run as NAT instances. These AMIs include the string amzn-ami-vpc-nat in their names, so you can search for them in the Amazon EC2 console. This option is ruled out because NAT instances are used to provide internet access to any instances in a private subnet.References:https://aws.amazon.com/privatelink/https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2018/12/amazon-sqs-vpc-endpoints-aws-privatelink/"

        "correct_answer": "Use CloudFront distribution in front of the Application Load Balancer",
        "explanation": "Correct options:You can use Aurora replicas and CloudFront distribution to make the application more resilient to spikes in request rates.Use Aurora ReplicaAurora Replicas have two main purposes. You can issue queries to them to scale the read operations for your application. You typically do so by connecting to the reader endpoint of the cluster. That way, Aurora can spread the load for read-only connections across as many Aurora Replicas as you have in the cluster. Aurora Replicas also help to increase availability. If the writer instance in a cluster becomes unavailable, Aurora automatically promotes one of the reader instances to take its place as the new writer. Up to 15 Aurora Replicas can be distributed across the Availability Zones that a DB cluster spans within an AWS Region.Use CloudFront distribution in front of the Application Load BalancerAmazon CloudFront is a fast content delivery network (CDN) service that securely delivers data, videos, applications, and APIs to customers globally with low latency, high transfer speeds, all within a developer-friendly environment. CloudFront points of presence (POPs) (edge locations) make sure that popular content can be served quickly to your viewers. CloudFront also has regional edge caches that bring more of your content closer to your viewers, even when the content is not popular enough to stay at a POP, to help improve performance for that content.CloudFront offers an origin failover feature to help support your data resiliency needs. CloudFront is a global service that delivers your content through a worldwide network of data centers called edge locations or points of presence (POPs). If your content is not already cached in an edge location, CloudFront retrieves it from an origin that you've identified as the source for the definitive version of the content.Incorrect options:* Use AWS Shield* - AWS Shield is a managed Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) protection service that safeguards applications running on AWS. AWS Shield provides always-on detection and automatic inline mitigations that minimize application downtime and latency. There are two tiers of AWS Shield - Standard and Advanced. Shield cannot be used to improve application resiliency to handle spikes in traffic.Use AWS Global Accelerator - AWS Global Accelerator is a service that improves the availability and performance of your applications with local or global users. It provides static IP addresses that act as a fixed entry point to your application endpoints in a single or multiple AWS Regions, such as your Application Load Balancers, Network Load Balancers or Amazon EC2 instances. Global Accelerator is a good fit for non-HTTP use cases, such as gaming (UDP), IoT (MQTT), or Voice over IP, as well as for HTTP use cases that specifically require static IP addresses or deterministic, fast regional failover. Since CloudFront is better for improving application resiliency to handle spikes in traffic, so this option is ruled out.Use AWS Direct Connect - AWS Direct Connect lets you establish a dedicated network connection between your network and one of the AWS Direct Connect locations. Using industry-standard 802.1q VLANs, this dedicated connection can be partitioned into multiple virtual interfaces. AWS Direct Connect does not involve the Internet; instead, it uses dedicated, private network connections between your intranet and Amazon VPC. Direct Connect cannot be used to improve application resiliency to handle spikes in traffic.References:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/disaster-recovery-resiliency.htmlhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Aurora.Replication.htmlhttps://aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/faqs/https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/disaster-recovery-resiliency.html"

        ],
        "correct_answer": "Copy data from the source bucket to the destination bucket using the aws S3 sync command",
        "explanation": "Correct options:Copy data from the source bucket to the destination bucket using the aws S3 sync commandThe aws S3 sync command uses the CopyObject APIs to copy objects between S3 buckets. The sync command lists the source and target buckets to identify objects that are in the source bucket but that aren't in the target bucket. The command also identifies objects in the source bucket that have different LastModified dates than the objects that are in the target bucket. The sync command on a versioned bucket copies only the current version of the object—previous versions aren't copied. By default, this preserves object metadata, but the access control lists (ACLs) are set to FULL_CONTROL for your AWS account, which removes any additional ACLs. If the operation fails, you can run the sync command again without duplicating previously copied objects.You can use the command like so:aws s3 sync s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET-SOURCE s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET-TARGETSet up S3 batch replication to copy objects across S3 buckets in different Regions using S3 consoleS3 Batch Replication provides you a way to replicate objects that existed before a replication configuration was in place, objects that have previously been replicated, and objects that have failed replication. This is done through the use of a Batch Operations job.You should note that batch replication differs from live replication which continuously and automatically replicates new objects across Amazon S3 buckets. You cannot directly use the AWS S3 console to configure cross-Region replication for existing objects. By default, replication only supports copying new Amazon S3 objects after it is enabled using the AWS S3 console. Replication enables automatic, asynchronous copying of objects across Amazon S3 buckets. Buckets that are configured for object replication can be owned by the same AWS account or by different accounts. Object may be replicated to a single destination bucket or multiple destination buckets. Destination buckets can be in different AWS Regions or within the same Region as the source bucket.If you want to enable live replication for existing objects for your bucket, you must contact AWS Support and raise a support ticket. This is required to ensure that replication is configured correctly.Incorrect options:Use Snowball Edge device to copy the data from one Region to another Region - As the given requirement is about copying the data from one AWS Region to another AWS Region, so Snowball Edge cannot be used here. Snowball Edge Storage Optimized is the optimal data transfer choice if you need to securely and quickly transfer terabytes to petabytes of data to AWS. You can use Snowball Edge Storage Optimized if you have a large backlog of data to transfer or if you frequently collect data that needs to be transferred to AWS and your storage is in an area where high-bandwidth internet connections are not available or cost-prohibitive. Snowball Edge can operate in remote locations or harsh operating environments, such as factory floors, oil and gas rigs, mining sites, hospitals, and on moving vehicles.Copy data from the source S3 bucket to a target S3 bucket using the S3 console - AWS S3 console cannot be used to transfer 1PB of data from one bucket to another as it's not feasible. You must use S3 sync for this requirement.Set up S3 Transfer Acceleration to copy objects across S3 buckets in different Regions using S3 console - S3 Transfer Acceleration is a bucket-level feature that enables fast, easy, and secure transfers of files over long distances between your client and an S3 bucket. You cannot use Transfer Acceleration to copy objects across S3 buckets in different Regions using S3 console.References:https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/move-objects-s3-bucket/https://aws.amazon.com/snowball/faqs/https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/replication.html"

        "correct_answer": "Use Global Accelerator to provide a low latency way to distribute live sports results",
        "explanation": "Correct option:Use Global Accelerator to provide a low latency way to distribute live sports resultsAWS Global Accelerator is a networking service that helps you improve the availability and performance of the applications that you offer to your global users. AWS Global Accelerator is easy to set up, configure, and manage. It provides static IP addresses that provide a fixed entry point to your applications and eliminate the complexity of managing specific IP addresses for different AWS Regions and Availability Zones. AWS Global Accelerator always routes user traffic to the optimal endpoint based on performance, reacting instantly to changes in application health, your user’s location, and policies that you configure. Global Accelerator is a good fit for non-HTTP use cases, such as gaming (UDP), IoT (MQTT), or Voice over IP. Therefore, this option is correct.How AWS Global Accelerator Works {IMG_37} via - https://aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/Incorrect options:Use CloudFront to provide a low latency way to distribute live sports results - Amazon CloudFront is a fast content delivery network (CDN) service that securely delivers data, videos, applications, and APIs to customers globally with low latency, high transfer speeds, all within a developer-friendly environment.CloudFront points of presence (POPs) (edge locations) make sure that popular content can be served quickly to your viewers. CloudFront also has regional edge caches that bring more of your content closer to your viewers, even when the content is not popular enough to stay at a POP, to help improve performance for that content. Regional edge caches help with all types of content, particularly content that tends to become less popular over time. Examples include user-generated content, such as video, photos, or artwork; e-commerce assets such as product photos and videos; and news and event-related content that might suddenly find new popularity. CloudFront supports HTTP/RTMP protocol based requests, therefore this option is incorrect.Use Elastic Load Balancer to provide a low latency way to distribute live sports results - Elastic Load Balancer automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as Amazon EC2 instances, containers, IP addresses, and Lambda functions. It can handle the varying load of your application traffic in a single Availability Zone or across multiple Availability Zones. Elastic Load Balancer cannot help with decreasing latency of incoming traffic from the source.Use Auto Scaling group to provide a low latency way to distribute live sports results - Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling helps you ensure that you have the correct number of Amazon EC2 instances available to handle the load for your application. You create collections of EC2 instances, called Auto Scaling groups. You can specify the minimum number of instances in each Auto Scaling group, and Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling ensures that your group never goes below this size. Auto Scaling group cannot help with decreasing latency of incoming traffic from the source.Exam Alert:Please note the differences between the capabilities of Global Accelerator and CloudFront -AWS Global Accelerator and Amazon CloudFront are separate services that use the AWS global network and its edge locations around the world. CloudFront improves performance for both cacheable content (such as images and videos) and dynamic content (such as API acceleration and dynamic site delivery). Global Accelerator improves performance for a wide range of applications over TCP or UDP by proxying packets at the edge to applications running in one or more AWS Regions.Global Accelerator is a good fit for non-HTTP use cases, such as gaming (UDP), IoT (MQTT), or Voice over IP, as well as for HTTP use cases that specifically require static IP addresses or deterministic, fast regional failover. Both services integrate with AWS Shield for DDoS protection. References:https://aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/faqs/"

        ],
        "correct_answer": "Use Amazon Cognito User Pools",
        "explanation": "Correct option:Use Amazon Cognito User Pools - A user pool is a user directory in Amazon Cognito. You can leverage Amazon Cognito User Pools to either provide built-in user management or integrate with external identity providers, such as Facebook, Twitter, Google+, and Amazon. Whether your users sign-in directly or through a third party, all members of the user pool have a directory profile that you can access through a Software Development Kit (SDK).User pools provide: 1. Sign-up and sign-in services. 2. A built-in, customizable web UI to sign in users. 3. Social sign-in with Facebook, Google, Login with Amazon, and Sign in with Apple, as well as sign-in with SAML identity providers from your user pool. 4. User directory management and user profiles. 5. Security features such as multi-factor authentication (MFA), checks for compromised credentials, account takeover protection, and phone and email verification. 6. Customized workflows and user migration through AWS Lambda triggers.After creating an Amazon Cognito user pool, in API Gateway, you must then create a COGNITO_USER_POOLS authorizer that uses the user pool.Amazon Cognito User Pools: {IMG_38} via - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/serverless-applications-lens/identity-and-access-management.htmlIncorrect options:Use AWS_IAM authorization - For consumers who currently are located within your AWS environment or have the means to retrieve AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) temporary credentials to access your environment, you can use AWS_IAM authorization and add least-privileged permissions to the respective IAM role to securely invoke your API. API Gateway API Keys is not a security mechanism and should not be used for authorization unless it’s a public API. It should be used primarily to track a consumer’s usage across your API.Use API Gateway Lambda authorizer - If you have an existing Identity Provider (IdP), you can use an API Gateway Lambda authorizer to invoke a Lambda function to authenticate/validate a given user against your IdP. You can use a Lambda authorizer for custom validation logic based on identity metadata.A Lambda authorizer can send additional information derived from a bearer token or request context values to your backend service. For example, the authorizer can return a map containing user IDs, user names, and scope. By using Lambda authorizers, your backend does not need to map authorization tokens to user-centric data, allowing you to limit the exposure of such information to just the authorization function.When using Lambda authorizers, AWS strictly advises against passing credentials or any sort of sensitive data via query string parameters or headers, so this is not as secure as using Cognito User Pools.In addition, both these options do not offer built-in user management.Use Amazon Cognito Identity Pools - The two main components of Amazon Cognito are user pools and identity pools. Identity pools provide AWS credentials to grant your users access to other AWS services. To enable users in your user pool to access AWS resources, you can configure an identity pool to exchange user pool tokens for AWS credentials. So, identity pools aren't an authentication mechanism in themselves and hence aren't a choice for this use case.References:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/serverless-applications-lens/identity-and-access-management.htmlhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/apigateway-enable-cognito-user-pool.htmlhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-identity-pools.html"

Traffic between your VPC and the other service does not leave the Amazon network.Endpoints are virtual devices. They are horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC components. They allow communication between instances in your VPC and services without imposing availability risks or bandwidth constraints on your network traffic.There are two types of VPC endpoints: Interface Endpoints and Gateway Endpoints. An Interface Endpoint is an Elastic Network Interface with a private IP address from the IP address range of your subnet that serves as an entry point for traffic destined to a supported service.A Gateway Endpoint is a gateway that you specify as a target for a route in your route table for traffic destined to a supported AWS service.

            "Use Elastic Load Balancer to distribute traffic across deployments"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "Use AWS Global Accelerator to distribute a portion of traffic to a particular deployment",
        "explanation": "Correct option:Blue/green deployment is a technique for releasing applications by shifting traffic between two identical environments running different versions of the application: \"Blue\" is the currently running version and \"green\" the new version. This type of deployment allows you to test features in the green environment without impacting the currently running version of your application. When you’re satisfied that the green version is working properly, you can gradually reroute the traffic from the old blue environment to the new green environment. Blue/green deployments can mitigate common risks associated with deploying software, such as downtime and rollback capability.Use AWS Global Accelerator to distribute a portion of traffic to a particular deployment - AWS Global Accelerator is a network layer service that directs traffic to optimal endpoints over the AWS global network, this improves the availability and performance of your internet applications. It provides two static anycast IP addresses that act as a fixed entry point to your application endpoints in a single or multiple AWS Regions, such as your Application Load Balancers, Network Load Balancers, Elastic IP addresses or Amazon EC2 instances, in a single or in multiple AWS regions.AWS Global Accelerator uses endpoint weights to determine the proportion of traffic that is directed to endpoints in an endpoint group, and traffic dials to control the percentage of traffic that is directed to an endpoint group (an AWS region where your application is deployed).While relying on the DNS service is a great option for blue/green deployments, it may not fit use-cases that require a fast and controlled transition of the traffic. Some client devices and internet resolvers cache DNS answers for long periods; this DNS feature improves the efficiency of the DNS service as it reduces the DNS traffic across the Internet, and serves as a resiliency technique by preventing authoritative name-server overloads. The downside of this in blue/green deployments is that you don’t know how long it will take before all of your users receive updated IP addresses when you update a record, change your routing preference or when there is an application failure.With AWS Global Accelerator, you can shift traffic gradually or all at once between the blue and the green environment and vice-versa without being subject to DNS caching on client devices and internet resolvers, traffic dials and endpoint weights changes are effective within seconds.Incorrect options:Use Route 53 weighted routing to spread traffic across different deployments - Weighted routing lets you associate multiple resources with a single domain name (example.com) or subdomain name (acme.example.com) and choose how much traffic is routed to each resource. This can be useful for a variety of purposes, including load balancing and testing new versions of the software. As discussed earlier, DNS caching is a negative behavior for this use case and hence Route 53 is not a good option.Use Elastic Load Balancer to distribute traffic across deployments - An ELB can distribute traffic across healthy instances. You can also use the ALB weighted target groups feature for blue/green deployments as it does not rely on the DNS service. In addition you don’t need to create new ALBs for the green environment. As the use-case refers to a global application, so this option cannot be used for a multi-Region solution which is needed for the given requirement.Use AWS CodeDeploy deployment options to choose the right deployment - In CodeDeploy, a deployment is the process, and the components involved in the process, of installing content on one or more instances. This content can consist of code, web and configuration files, executables, packages, scripts, and so on. CodeDeploy deploys content that is stored in a source repository, according to the configuration rules you specify. Blue/Green deployment is one of the deployment types that CodeDeploy supports. CodeDeploy is not meant to distribute traffic across instances, so this option is incorrect.References:https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/using-aws-global-accelerator-to-achieve-blue-green-deploymentshttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/deployments.htmlhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-policy.html#routing-policy-weighted"

        "explanation": "Correct option:Use permissions boundary to control the maximum permissions employees can grant to the IAM principalsA permissions boundary can be used to control the maximum permissions employees can grant to the IAM principals (that is, users and roles) that they create and manage. As the IAM administrator, you can define one or more permissions boundaries using managed policies and allow your employee to create a principal with this boundary. The employee can then attach a permissions policy to this principal. However, the effective permissions of the principal are the intersection of the permissions boundary and permissions policy. As a result, the new principal cannot exceed the boundary that you defined.

You pay only for the compute time that you consume—there’s no charge when your code isn’t running. You can run code for virtually any type of application or backend service—all with zero administration.DynamoDB - Amazon DynamoDB is a key-value and document database that delivers single-digit millisecond performance at any scale. It's a fully managed, multi-region, multi-master, durable database with built-in security, backup and restore, and in-memory caching for internet-scale applications. DynamoDB is a NoSQL database and it's best suited to store data in key-value pairs.AWS Lambda can be combined with DynamoDB to process and capture the key-value data from the IoT sources described in the use-case. So both these options are correct.Incorrect options:Redshift - Amazon Redshift is a fully-managed petabyte-scale cloud-based data warehouse product designed for large scale data set storage and analysis.

        "explanation": "Correct option:Consolidated billing has not been enabled. All the AWS accounts should fall under a single consolidated billing for the monthly fee to be charged only once - If your organization has multiple AWS accounts, then you can subscribe multiple AWS Accounts to AWS Shield Advanced by individually enabling it on each account using the AWS Management Console or API. You will pay the monthly fee once as long as the AWS accounts are all under a single consolidated billing, and you own all the AWS accounts and resources in those accounts.Incorrect options:AWS Shield Advanced is being used for custom servers, that are not part of AWS Cloud, thereby resulting in increased costs - AWS Shield Advanced does offer protection to resources outside of AWS.

The source database remains fully operational during the migration, minimizing downtime to applications that rely on the database. With AWS Database Migration Service, you can continuously replicate your data with high availability and consolidate databases into a petabyte-scale data warehouse by streaming data to Amazon Redshift and Amazon S3.Continuous Data Replication {IMG_46} via - https://aws.amazon.com/dms/You can migrate data to Amazon Redshift databases using AWS Database Migration Service. Amazon Redshift is a fully managed, petabyte-scale data warehouse service in the cloud. With an Amazon Redshift database as a target, you can migrate data from all of the other supported source databases.The Amazon Redshift cluster must be in the same AWS account and the same AWS Region as the replication instance. During a database migration to Amazon Redshift, AWS DMS first moves data to an Amazon S3 bucket. When the files reside in an Amazon S3 bucket, AWS DMS then transfers them to the proper tables in the Amazon Redshift data warehouse. AWS DMS creates the S3 bucket in the same AWS Region as the Amazon Redshift database. The AWS DMS replication instance must be located in that same region.Incorrect options:Use AWS Glue to replicate the data from the databases into Amazon Redshift - AWS Glue is a fully managed extract, transform, and load (ETL) service that makes it easy for customers to prepare and load their data for analytics. AWS Glue job is meant to be used for batch ETL data processing.Using AWS Glue involves significant development efforts to write custom migration scripts to copy the database data into Redshift.Use AWS EMR to replicate the data from the databases into Amazon Redshift - Amazon EMR is the industry-leading cloud big data platform for processing vast amounts of data using open source tools such as Apache Spark, Apache Hive, Apache HBase, Apache Flink, Apache Hudi, and Presto. With EMR you can run Petabyte-scale analysis at less than half of the cost of traditional on-premises solutions and over 3x faster than standard Apache Spark. For short-running jobs, you can spin up and spin down clusters and pay per second for the instances used. For long-running workloads, you can create highly available clusters that automatically scale to meet demand. Amazon EMR uses Hadoop, an open-source framework, to distribute your data and processing across a resizable cluster of Amazon EC2 instances.Using EMR involves significant infrastructure management efforts to set up and maintain the EMR cluster. Additionally this option involves a major development effort to write custom migration jobs to copy the database data into Redshift.Use Amazon Kinesis Data Streams to replicate the data from the databases into Amazon Redshift - Amazon Kinesis Data Streams (KDS) is a massively scalable and durable real-time data streaming service. KDS can continuously capture gigabytes of data per second from hundreds of thousands of sources such as website clickstreams, database event streams, financial transactions, social media feeds, IT logs, and location-tracking events.However, the user is expected to manually provision an appropriate number of shards to process the expected volume of the incoming data stream. The throughput of an Amazon Kinesis data stream is designed to scale without limits via increasing the number of shards within a data stream.

        "correct_answer": "VPN CloudHub",
        "explanation": "Correct option:VPN CloudHubIf you have multiple AWS Site-to-Site VPN connections, you can provide secure communication between sites using the AWS VPN CloudHub. This enables your remote sites to communicate with each other, and not just with the VPC. Sites that use AWS Direct Connect connections to the virtual private gateway can also be part of the AWS VPN CloudHub. The VPN CloudHub operates on a simple hub-and-spoke model that you can use with or without a VPC. This design is suitable if you have multiple branch offices and existing internet connections and would like to implement a convenient, potentially low-cost hub-and-spoke model for primary or backup connectivity between these remote offices.Per the given use-case, the corporate headquarters has an AWS Direct Connect connection to the VPC and the branch offices have Site-to-Site VPN connections to the VPC. Therefore using the AWS VPN CloudHub, branch offices can send and receive data with each other as well as with their corporate headquarters.VPN CloudHub {IMG_49} via - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/s2svpn/VPN_CloudHub.htmlIncorrect options:VPC Endpoint - A VPC endpoint enables you to privately connect your VPC to supported AWS services and VPC endpoint services powered by AWS PrivateLink without requiring an internet gateway, NAT device, VPN connection, or AWS Direct Connect connection. Instances in your VPC do not require public IP addresses to communicate with resources in the service. AWS PrivateLink simplifies the security of data shared with cloud-based applications by eliminating the exposure of data to the public Internet. When you use VPC endpoint, the traffic between your VPC and the other AWS service does not leave the Amazon network, therefore this option cannot be used to send and receive data between the remote branch offices of the company.VPC Peering - A VPC peering connection is a networking connection between two VPCs that enables you to route traffic between them using private IPv4 addresses or IPv6 addresses. Instances in either VPC can communicate with each other as if they are within the same network. VPC peering facilitates a connection between two VPCs within the AWS network, therefore this option cannot be used to send and receive data between the remote branch offices of the company.Software VPN - Amazon VPC offers you the flexibility to fully manage both sides of your Amazon VPC connectivity by creating a VPN connection between your remote network and a software VPN appliance running in your Amazon VPC network. Since Software VPN just handles connectivity between the remote network and Amazon VPC, therefore it cannot be used to send and receive data between the remote branch offices of the company.References:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-vpc-connectivity-options/aws-vpn-cloudhub-network-to-amazon.htmlhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/s2svpn/VPN_CloudHub.html"

SQS eliminates the complexity and overhead associated with managing and operating message oriented middleware, and empowers developers to focus on differentiating work. Using SQS, you can send, store, and receive messages between software components at any volume, without losing messages or requiring other services to be available.SQS offers two types of message queues. Standard queues offer maximum throughput, best-effort ordering, and at-least-once delivery. SQS FIFO queues are designed to guarantee that messages are processed exactly once, in the exact order that they are sent.By default, FIFO queues support up to 3,000 messages per second with batching, or up to 300 messages per second (300 send, receive, or delete operations per second) without batching. Therefore, using batching you can meet a throughput requirement of upto 3,000 messages per second. The name of a FIFO queue must end with the .fifo suffix. The suffix counts towards the 80-character queue name limit. To determine whether a queue is FIFO, you can check whether the queue name ends with the suffix.If you have an existing application that uses standard queues and you want to take advantage of the ordering or exactly-once processing features of FIFO queues, you need to configure the queue and your application correctly. You can't convert an existing standard queue into a FIFO queue. To make the move, you must either create a new FIFO queue for your application or delete your existing standard queue and recreate it as a FIFO queue.Incorrect options:Convert the existing standard queue into a FIFO queue - You can't convert an existing standard queue into a FIFO queue.Make sure that the name of the FIFO queue is the same as the standard queue - The name of a FIFO queue must end with the .fifo suffix.Make sure that the throughput for the target FIFO queue does not exceed 300 messages per second - By default, FIFO queues support up to 3,000 messages per second with batching.

The source database remains fully operational during the migration, minimizing downtime to applications that rely on the database. AWS Database Migration Service supports homogeneous migrations such as Oracle to Oracle, as well as heterogeneous migrations between different database platforms, such as Oracle or Microsoft SQL Server to Amazon Aurora.Given the use-case where the CTO at the company wants to move away from license-based expensive, legacy commercial database solutions deployed at the on-premises data center to more efficient, open-source, and cost-effective options on AWS Cloud, this is an example of heterogeneous database migrations.For such a scenario, the source and target databases engines are different, like in the case of Oracle to Amazon Aurora, Oracle to PostgreSQL, or Microsoft SQL Server to MySQL migrations. In this case, the schema structure, data types, and database code of source and target databases can be quite different, requiring a schema and code transformation before the data migration starts.That makes heterogeneous migrations a two-step process. First use the AWS Schema Conversion Tool to convert the source schema and code to match that of the target database, and then use the AWS Database Migration Service to migrate data from the source database to the target database. All the required data type conversions will automatically be done by the AWS Database Migration Service during the migration. The source database can be located on your on-premises environment outside of AWS, running on an Amazon EC2 instance, or it can be an Amazon RDS database. The target can be a database in Amazon EC2 or Amazon RDS.Heterogeneous Database Migrations {IMG_53} via - https://aws.amazon.com/dms/Incorrect options:AWS Snowball Edge - Snowball Edge Storage Optimized is the optimal choice if you need to securely and quickly transfer dozens of terabytes to petabytes of data to AWS. It provides up to 80 TB of usable HDD storage, 40 vCPUs, 1 TB of SATA SSD storage, and up to 40 Gb network connectivity to address large scale data transfer and pre-processing use cases. As each Snowball Edge Storage Optimized device can handle 80TB of data, you can order 10 such devices to take care of the data transfer for all applications. The original Snowball devices were transitioned out of service and Snowball Edge Storage Optimized are now the primary devices used for data transfer. You may see the Snowball device on the exam, just remember that the original Snowball device had 80TB of storage space. AWS Snowball Edge cannot be used for database migrations.AWS Glue - AWS Glue is a fully managed extract, transform, and load (ETL) service that makes it easy for customers to prepare and load their data for analytics. AWS Glue job is meant to be used for batch ETL data processing. Therefore, it cannot be used for database migrations.Basic Schema Copy - To quickly migrate a database schema to your target instance you can rely on the Basic Schema Copy feature of AWS Database Migration Service. Basic Schema Copy will automatically create tables and primary keys in the target instance if the target does not already contain tables with the same names. Basic Schema Copy is great for doing a test migration, or when you are migrating databases heterogeneously e.g. Oracle to MySQL or SQL Server to Oracle. Basic Schema Copy will not migrate secondary indexes, foreign keys or stored procedures. When you need to use a more customizable schema migration process (e.g. when you are migrating your production database and need to move your stored procedures and secondary database objects), you must use the AWS Schema Conversion Tool.References:https://aws.amazon.com/dms/https://aws.amazon.com/dms/faqs/https://aws.amazon.com/dms/schema-conversion-tool/"

To set this up, the account that owns the VPC (owner) shares one or more subnets with other accounts (participants) that belong to the same organization from AWS Organizations. After a subnet is shared, the participants can view, create, modify, and delete their application resources in the subnets shared with them. Participants cannot view, modify, or delete resources that belong to other participants or the VPC owner.You can share Amazon VPCs to leverage the implicit routing within a VPC for applications that require a high degree of interconnectivity and are within the same trust boundaries. This reduces the number of VPCs that you create and manage while using separate accounts for billing and access control.Incorrect options:Use VPC sharing to share a VPC with other AWS accounts belonging to the same parent organization from AWS Organizations - Using VPC sharing, an account that owns the VPC (owner) shares one or more subnets with other accounts (participants) that belong to the same organization from AWS Organizations. The owner account cannot share the VPC itself. Therefore this option is incorrect.Use VPC peering to share one or more subnets with other AWS accounts belonging to the same parent organization from AWS Organizations - A VPC peering connection is a networking connection between two VPCs that enables you to route traffic between them using private IPv4 addresses or IPv6 addresses. Instances in either VPC can communicate with each other as if they are within the same network. VPC peering does not facilitate centrally managed VPCs. Therefore this option is incorrect.Use VPC peering to share a VPC with other AWS accounts belonging to the same parent organization from AWS Organizations - A VPC peering connection is a networking connection between two VPCs that enables you to route traffic between them using private IPv4 addresses or IPv6 addresses.
